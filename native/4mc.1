.SH NAME
\fB4mc\fR - 4 More Compression - \fBLZ4\fR compression power unleashed

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fB4mc\fR [\fBOPTIONS\fR] [-|INPUT-FILE] <OUTPUT-FILE>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB4mc\fR (4 More Compression) is a compression file format which leverages the power of \fBLZ4\fR algorithm. It has been designed to add more features to existing big data solutions like HADOOP/ElephantBird: LZ4 is fastest compression/decompression but not only! LZ4 can be tuned to have a seamless tradeoff between CPU time and compression ratio:
 (1) Fast Compression: default one reaching up to 500 MB/s (LZ4 fast)
 (2) Medium Compression: half speed of fast mode, +13% ratio (LZ4 MC)
 (3) High Compression: 5x slower than fast, +25% ratio (LZ4 HC lvl 4)
 (4) Ultra Compression: 13x slower than fast, +30% ratio (LZ4 HC lvl 8) 
   
\fB4mc\fR supports following options
